# Tetris Remake Python
A version of modern Tetris using the Tetris Guidelines made from scratch in Python.

This version of Tetris was made with the intention of training an AI on it, so the VS implementation is not meant for human vs human play.
Run 'game.py' to play a normal game, and run 'vs.py' to begin a VS match.

Controls:
Left/Right Arrow Keys - Left/Right
Down Arrow Key - Soft Drop
X / Up Arrow Key - Clockwise Rotation
Z - Counterclockwise Rotation
C - Hold Piece
Space - Hard Drop
